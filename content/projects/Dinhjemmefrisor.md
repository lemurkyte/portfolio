Dinhjemmefrisør.dk is the most exciting project I have worked on, because it was about starting a brand identity from scratch. After interviewing the client about his vision, values, concept of the company and comprehend competitor research I started invisioning a design. 
<br>
<br>


Since the concept of the company is providing on-demand men-haircuts everywhere, where it suits the customer, a key aspect was to raise trustfullness of the brand. 
<br>
<br>

### Design
After the research and interview with the owner of the company I decided to go with muted colors, 
Client wanted a minimalistic and neat website, which is easy to navigate and doesn't have tons of scrolling.
