## Description of an internship at Novicell

During my 4-week internship at Novicell, I debuted by creating a portfolio website. I believe this endeavor proved to be doubly efficient as it helped me overcome my procrastination in creating one, while also serving as a valuable tool for maintaining a comprehensive record of my professional accomplishments. Additionally, it enhanced the visibility of my profile, increasing the likelihood of being noticed by potential employers.
<br><br>
Moreover, the process of developing the website provided an excellent opportunity to refresh my knowledge of <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>Nuxt</strong>, as well as acquire more knowledge of <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It served as a valuable practice session to brush up on my existing proficiency in these technologies, which had become somewhat rusty over time.
<br><br>
Overall, the experience of creating my portfolio website at Novicell was not only highly productive, but it also facilitated professional growth and skill development. I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with these technologies and eagerly anticipate applying the lessons learned in future endeavors.
<br><br>
Another project I did was creating a user interface of a week board for one of Novicell's internal systems, called Drools.

                &lt;p&gt;{{ new Date(project.date).toLocaleDateString() }}&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/NuxtLink&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

</pre>

`<div v-for="project in filteredProjects" :key="project.slug"> ` 

I used a v-for directive to iterate over the filteredProjects array and create a `<div>` element for each project. The `:key` attribute binds the project.slug as the unique identifier for each element. 

`<NuxtLink class="underline" :to="project._path">`: This is a Vue.js component provided by Nuxt.js. It represents a link to another page in the application. The `:to` attribute sets the target path of the link based on project._path.

`<img :src="img/${project.img}" :alt="project.img" class="card-image">`: This line dynamically sets the src attribute of the `<img>` element based on the project.img property. The `:alt` attribute sets the alternative text for the image. The class="card-image" sets the class name to "card-image" for styling purposes.

`<h2 class="card-title">{{ project.title }}</h2>`: This line displays the project.title property as the content of an `<h2>` element. The class="card-title" sets the class name to "card-title" for styling purposes.

`<p class="description">{{ project.description }}</p>`: This line displays the project.description property as the content of a `<p>` element. The class="description" sets the class name to "description" for styling purposes.

`<div class="tags-wrapper">...</div>: This <div> `element is a container for tags specific to each project. It is similar to the tags container mentioned earlier.

`<p>{{ new Date(project.date).toLocaleDateString() }}</p>`: This line displays the project.date property as a formatted date using the toLocaleDateString method of the JavaScript Date object. The result is shown inside a `<p>` element.

In summary, the code represents a template for rendering a list of projects with associated tags. It utilizes Vue.js directives for iterating over arrays, handling events, and dynamically displaying data.

### Hamburger menu on load


To close the menu when a NuxtLink is clicked and the page loads I use the onMounted hook to attach a click event listener to each NuxtLink element with the class "n-link-base". When a NuxtLink is clicked, the isMenuOpen value is set to false, thereby closing the menu.

<pre style="background-color: #2e3440">
  <code data-language="javascript">
    onMounted(() =&gt; {
      const menuLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.n-link-base')

      menuLinks.forEach(link =&gt; {
        link.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
          isMenuOpen.value = false
        })
      })
    })

## Designing iternal system's interface
During the second week of my internship, I was assigned the task of implementing a new interface for the Week Board page in Drools. Thankfully, the workflow was smooth due to the fact that the designers had already created designs and components for other pages.

The design for the interface was created using Figma, which was a new experience for me. However, since I have ample experience using Adobe XD, adapting to this new collaborative interface design tool wasn't difficult. The principles of Figma are similar to XD Design, making the transition relatively seamless.

To reduce cognitive load, I opted for an icon + label combination when displaying the phone number for the PHP department. Additionally, I included the starting and finishing dates of the week to assist international employees who may find it challenging to remember. To further enhance the user experience, I decided to highlight the current day of the week by adding a border around it. Furthermore, I ensured that the foreground and background colors met WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compatibility standards, and it successfully passed the required tests.
