### Planning and Design:
During the planning phase, I worked closely with the client to outline the website's structure, content, and design. We created a sitemap to determine the main pages and their hierarchical structure. Based on the client's preferences and the target audience's expectations, we crafted a design concept that would convey a modern and playful vibe, while still maintaining a professional appearance. The design incorporated the use of vibrant colors, engaging images, and an intuitive user interface.
