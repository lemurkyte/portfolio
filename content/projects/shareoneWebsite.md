# ShareOne
I had an honor to collaborate with ShareOne since my studies. It was a delightful experience to see how the company I joined as a start up grew sucessfully with the help of my expertise. So did I, because the projects I worked on required lots of UX and design skills, which I brought from my education, but the practise was what it took to challenge myself applying knowledge to a real-life case.

My first project was to create several new layouts for the website. Even though brand identity was already developed and I needed to follow existing design, it was a big responsibility in terms of UX. 

## Website layouts
Pages I created in Shareone website:

- Home page
- Forsikring
- Item page

I also designed a ShareOne app's interface. Read more about my collaboration with ShareOne: [ShareOne App](/projects/shareoneapp)
