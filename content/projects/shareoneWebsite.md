# ShareOne
I had the privilege of collaborating with ShareOne since my studies. It was a rewarding experience witnessing the successful growth of the company, aided by my expertise. The projects I undertook demanded a considerable application of my UX and design skills, which I had acquired through my education. However, it was the practical experience that truly challenged me to apply my knowledge to real-life scenarios.

One of my initial assignments involved creating multiple new layouts for the website. While the brand identity had already been established, I had the significant responsibility of ensuring a seamless user experience (UX) within the confines of the existing design guidelines.

## Development of ShareOne.dk Website UI

I had the opportunity to create the UI design for three key pages of the ShareOne.dk website:
- Home
- Forsikring (Insurance)
- Single item 

Here's a brief overview of the development process for each page:

### Home Page:
The Home page is the main landing page of the ShareOne.dk website. I focused on creating a visually engaging and informative design that would effectively convey the company's services and value proposition. Utilizing a clean and modern aesthetic, I carefully selected colors, typography, and imagery that aligned with the company's brand identity. The layout was designed to provide a clear and intuitive navigation experience, allowing visitors to easily find the information they need.

### Forsikring (Insurance) Page:
The Forsikring page serves as a dedicated section on the website to showcase the company's insurance services. I approached the UI design with the goal of presenting the information in a structured and easily digestible format. Clear headings, well-organized content blocks, and visually appealing graphics were employed to enhance the overall readability and visual appeal of the page. Attention was given to ensure that the design elements aligned with the website's overall visual theme, maintaining a consistent user experience.

### Single Item Page:
The Single Item page focuses on providing detailed information about a specific renting product offered on ShareOne.dk. I aimed to create a visually striking layout that highlights the key features and benefits of the item. Emphasis was placed on the use of informative descriptions and clear calls-to-action to encourage user engagement. The design was crafted to be responsive and accessible across various devices, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for users.

Throughout the UI design process, I prioritized user experience and usability. I paid attention to factors such as intuitive navigation, consistency in design elements, and clear information hierarchy to guide users through the website effortlessly. I also incorporated visual cues and interactive elements to enhance user engagement and interactivity on the pages.

The resulting UI designs aimed to effectively communicate the company's services, captivate users, and foster engagement on the website.

I also designed a ShareOne app's interface. Read more about my collaboration with ShareOne: [ShareOne App](/projects/shareoneapp)
